            <li>Add in chicken bouillon powder, fish sauce, soy sauce, and white pepper. Mix to incorporate everything together. Turn off the heat and transfer the meat to a bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat a large pot of water and let it come to a boil. Add in the egg noodles and cook according to package directions, about 2-3 minutes, or until al dente. Pour the noodles into a colander and rinse under cold water. Drain noodles and portion into serving bowls.</li>
            <li>Top the noodles with the 2-3 heaping tablespoons of the warm ground pork mixture, green onions, sliced BBQ pork (char siu), wontons, pickled chilies, and fried onion flakes.</li>
